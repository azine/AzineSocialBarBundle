AzineSocialBarBundle
====================

Symfony2 Bundle to easily create a social bar in your twig templates.

Special thanx to Gregquat who posted a good how to get stared here:

http://obtao.com/blog/2012/11/create-a-social-buttons-bar-for-facebook-twitter-and-google-with-symfony2/

As a lot of code is copied from that page, most of the documentation on how to use it in your twig-templates applies as well.
